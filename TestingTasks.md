# Testing practice

Let's create a small application that simulates a simple banking system. This application will include several functions such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the balance. We’ll enhance the exercises to cover more complex scenarios, including additional functions, interactions between them, and more extensive testing. 

### Small Banking Application Structure

1. **Create a new Python module** named `bank.py` with the following classes and methods:

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        """Initialize an account with an owner name and an optional starting balance.

        Args:
            owner (str): The name of the account owner.
            balance (float): The initial balance of the account (default is 0).
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposit a positive amount into the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to deposit.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the deposit amount is not positive.

        Returns:
            float: The new balance after the deposit.
        """
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive")
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Withdraw a positive amount from the account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to withdraw.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the withdrawal amount is not positive or exceeds the balance.

        Returns:
            float: The new balance after the withdrawal.
        """
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount must be positive")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount
        return self.balance

    def get_balance(self):
        """Get the current balance of the account.

        Returns:
            float: The current balance.
        """
        return self.balance

    def transfer(self, amount, to_account):
        """Transfer a positive amount to another account.

        Args:
            amount (float): The amount to transfer.
            to_account (Account): The account to which the amount is transferred.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the transfer amount is not positive or exceeds the balance.
        """
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Transfer amount must be positive")
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.withdraw(amount)
        to_account.deposit(amount)
```

#### Exercise 1: Write Unit Tests for Account (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Write basic unit tests for the `Account` class's functionalities.

1. **Create a new file** named `test_bank.py` and implement basic tests. Include docstrings in your test cases.

   ```python
   import pytest
   from bank import Account

   def test_initial_balance():
       # TODO

   def test_deposit():
       # TODO

   def test_withdraw():
       # TODO
   ```

#### Exercise 2: Add Tests for Error Handling (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Test exception handling for the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods. Feel free to google for examples on how to test for exceptions.

1. **Extend `test_bank.py`** to include tests for wrong inputs. Include docstrings in your test cases.

   ```python
   def test_deposit_negative_amount():
       # TODO

   def test_withdraw_more_than_balance():
       # TODO

   def test_withdraw_negative_amount():
       # TODO
   ```

#### Exercise 3: Using Fixtures (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Use pytest fixtures to create reusable account setups. Create a fixture to produce an account object with a specific balance and use it in other tests in `test_bank.py`.


#### Exercise 4: Parameterization (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Test the `transfer` method using parameterized tests.


#### Exercise 5: Integration Testing (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Test interactions between multiple Account objects in a more complex scenario.

1. **Extend `test_bank.py`** to add integration tests that test transfers between two different customers' accounts.
